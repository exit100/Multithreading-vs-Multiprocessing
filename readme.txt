Open the terminal in the directory of main.c
Type make to compile the program.

Open the terminal in all 3 folders: merge, multiplication, and search.
Type make each time to compile the programs.

To run the program, change directory to the original folder and type ./main in the terminal.

OBJECTIVE: 
The main objective of our project is to focus on the differences
between multithreading and multiprocessing. The performance
comparison will be observed by the implementation of merge sort,
linear search and matrix multiplication.
